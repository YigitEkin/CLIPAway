### **Abstract:** 

> Advanced image editing techniques, particularly inpainting, are essential for seamlessly removing unwanted elements while preserving visual integrity. Traditional GAN-based methods have achieved notable success, but recent advancements in diffusion models have produced superior results due to their training on large-scale datasets, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic inpainted images.Despite their strengths, diffusion models often struggle with object removal tasks without explicit guidance, leading to unintended hallucinations of the removed object. To address this issue, we introduce CLIPAway, a novel approach leveraging CLIP embeddings to focus on background regions while excluding foreground elements. CLIPAway enhances inpainting accuracy and quality by identifying embeddings that prioritize the background, thus achieving seamless object removal. Unlike other methods that rely on specialized training datasets or costly manual annotations, CLIPAway provides a flexible, plug-and-play solution compatible with various diffusion-based inpainting techniques.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YigitEkin/CLIPAway.git
cd CLIPAway
```

### Source Code Downloads

Our model uses pretrained Alpha-CLIP networks. Make sure that you are at the root directory of the repository and then clone the Alpha-CLIP repository:
To clone the source code of Alpha-CLIP, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunzeY/AlphaCLIP.git
```
### Environment Setup
Clone Alpha-CLIP and ensure it's in the repository's root directory. Please refer to the [Source Code Downloads](#source-code-downloads). After that, environment setup process can be started.
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is recommended to install the required dependencies. These dependencies are specified in the conda environment named `clipaway`, which can be created and activated as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate clipaway
```
### Pretrained Models 
To download the pretrained models for Alpha-CLIP, IP-Adapter, and our MLP projection network use the script that we provide:

```bash
./download_pretrained_models.sh
```

Alternatively, the pretrained models can be downloaded manually as follows:
****NOTE:**** If you are executing the following commands manually, please make sure that you are in the root directory of the repository.
```bash
mkdir ckpts ckpts/AlphaCLIP ckpts/IPAdapter ckpts/CLIPAway
cd ckpts/AlphaCLIP
gdown 1JfzOTvjf0tqBtKWwpBJtjYxdHi-06dbk
cd ../IPAdapter
wget https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter/resolve/main/models/ip-adapter_sd15.bin
mkdir image_encoder && cd image_encoder
wget https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter/resolve/main/models/image_encoder/pytorch_model.bin
wget https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter/resolve/main/models/image_encoder/config.json
cd ../../CLIPAway
gdown 1lFHAT2dF5GVRJLxkF1039D53gixHXaTx
cd ../../
```
It is important to note that these scripts will download the pretrained models that we have used in our experiments. However, other pretrained models can be used according to users' preferences.

### Dataset Preparation
For training the **MLP projection network**, we provide a dataset class which can be edited according to the dataset of choice. The dataset class is located in `dataset/dataset.py`.

For training and validation datasets the expected file structure is as follows:

```
root_path
├── image1.jpg
├── image2.jpg
└── ...
```
As masks are static full masks, they are not required to be in the dataset folder. Only the images are required.

For test dataset, the expected file structure is as follows:

```
root_path
├── images
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
└── masks
    ├── image1.png
    ├── image2.png
    └── ...
```
The masks should be in the same folder with the same name as the images. The masks should be in .png format.

**Note:** We have trained our MLP projection network on [COCO 2017 Training Dataset](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip). for calculating the validation loss, we have used [COCO 2017 Test Dataset](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/test2017.zip).
The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link or by using the following commands:

```bash
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
unzip train2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/test2017.zip
unzip test2017.zip
rm train2017.zip test2017.zip
```
Make sure that you update the configuration file with the correct paths to the training and validation datasets.

### Training

We provide a code for training the MLP projection network. The training code can be run using the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config <path_to_training_config>
```
It is important to note that the training code uses the training configuration file to set the parameters of the training process. The configuration file should be edited according to the users' preferences.

The description of the parameters in the training configuration file is as follows:

| Args                          | Description                                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --data_path                   | Path to the training data directory, where the training images are stored. |
| --val_path                    | Path to the validation data directory, used for evaluating the model during training. |
| --train_batch_size            | Batch size for training, which determines the number of samples processed before the model is updated. |
| --val_batch_size              | Batch size for validation, which determines the number of samples processed during evaluation. |
| --lr                          | Learning rate for the optimizer, which controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. |
| --weight_decay                | Weight decay (L2 regularization) parameter, which helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. |
| --eval_interval               | Interval (in steps) at which to evaluate the model.               |

### Inference
**Note:** Our best performing model is built upon [SD-Inpaint](https://huggingface.co/botp/stable-diffusion-v1-5-inpainting) which downscales the provided mask to dimension of the latent for determining the inpainting region. This downscaling can cause some inconsistencies and result in artifacts. To prevent this, we advise you to dilate your masks before using them in the inference process. We provide a script for dilating the masks which can be run as follows:

```bash
python3 dilate.py --directory <path_to_masks> --kernel-size 5 --iterations 5
```
the description of the arguments are as follows:
| Args | Description
| :--- | :----------
| --directory | Path to the directory containing the masks
| --kernel-size | Size of the kernel for dilation
| --iterations | Number of iterations for dilation

After dilation, the inference code can be run on a directory of images using the following command:
```bash
python3 inference.py --config <path_to_inference_config>
```
It is important to note that the inference code uses the inference configuration file to set the parameters of the inference process. The configuration file should be edited according to the users' preferences.
